Welcome! This repo seeks to be an ever-improving starting point for interviewees when asked the question 'Do you have any questions for us?'. Our target audience is anyone in a technical role as related to software development. The creators, [gravyboat](https://github.com/gravyboat) and [preston4tw](https://github.com/Preston4tw) are SREs, but these questions are largely applicable to all aspects of software development. Companies are encouraged to reduce the friction in their hiring process by pro-actively answering the questions here in and making the answers publically available. Fork us and host your answers on your own public repo, or throw us a merge request! Think of this as an expanded version of [The Joel Test](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html).

These questions are largely sourced from past work experience greivances of the committers as well as public suggestions from others. See [questionnaire.md](questionnaire.md) for the full list of questions.
