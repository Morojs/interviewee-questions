Welcome! This repo seeks to be an ever-improving starting point for technical
interviewees when asked the question 'Do you have any questions for us?'. We
have a ton! We ([gravyboat](https://github.com/gravyboat) and
[preston4tw](https://github.com/Preston4tw)) are SREs in search of awesome
places to work. This questionnaire is our personal aid in filtering companies we
interview with to determine how awesome they are and whether or not we want to
work there. This questionnaire was created collaboratively in response to some
less than great past work experience. We think most of the questions are
applicable to any technical interviewee and share it with the public in the hope
that it's useful. Our target audience is twofold:

1. Anyone in a technical role as related to software development.
2. Companies that want to hire IT people. Not only should you expect these
   questions from candidates and be prepared for them, the extent to which you
   can answer these questions in an awesome fashion is a competitive advantage
   that will draw high quality candidates to your company looking for work.
   Everyone is hiring, and there aren't a lot of awesome techies to go
   around. The [Netflix](http://www.slideshare.net/reed2001/culture-1798664)
   and [Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf)
   culture docs are required reading.

PRs to add questions are welcome!

If you're a company answering these, we highly encourage you to make your
answers public! Host the filled out questionnaire on your own public github
account, or set up a PR and we'll host your answers here so you can show off how
awesome your company is comparatively. If you have some questions you would love
to see asked we also like PRs to expand our questions as well!
